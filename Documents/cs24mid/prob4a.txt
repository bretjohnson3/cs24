Explicit Allocator Scenario:  Allocation Fails under First-Fit but not Best-Fit
===============================================================================

We start with a total heap size of 16 KB.

Here is the order of allocations and frees:
    
    0. Begin withh heap size of 16 KB.
    1. Allocate block of size 8 KB.
    2. Allocate block of size 4 KB.
    3. Free block from instruction 1.
    4. Allocate block of size 2 KB.
    5. Try to allocate block of size 8 KB -->>> results in Allocation Failure


Here is the final state of the memory:

Allocated Block of 2KB -> Free Block of 6KB -> Allocated Block of 4KB -> Free Block of 4 KB


Here is the diagram of memory management from the instructions above where F represents 
a free KB and A represents an allocated KB and | separates adjacent allocated blocks:

[FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF] -> [AAAAAAAAFFFFFFFF] -> [AAAAAAAA|AAAAFFFF] -> [FFFFFFFFAAAAFFFF] ->

[AAFFFFFFAAAAFFFF] -> ALLOCATION FAILURE
