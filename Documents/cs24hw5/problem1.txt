Set 5
Problem 1

Part a)

We have a program on a 3 GHz processor so we have accesses of
3 * 10 ^ 9 clocks per second.

Our application is completing only 750 * 10^6 instructions / second.

We access values from the cache in one clock and values in main memory in
100 clocks.

We represent our hit rate, y, which is a measure of how often we have accesses
that hit the cash (these take one clock). We have a miss rate which is equal to
1 - y.  Overall we have an access of x = y + (1 -y)*100 clocks / instruction

From that we get the equation:

750*10^6 instructions / sec = (3*10^9 clocks / sec) / (x clocks / instruction)

We plug in x = y + (1 - y)*100 and solve the equation for y.

We get y = 96/99 = 0.9696 (approx) meaning our miss rate is
1 - y = 3 / 99 = 0.3030 (approx)


Part b)

We now want double the performance of instuctions per second.

This makes our equation:

1500*10^6 instructions / sec = (3*10^9 clocks / sec) / (x clocks / instruction)

We solve and get that we need a hit rate of 98 / 99 = 0.9898 (approx)
meaning a miss rate of 1 / 99 = 0.0101 (approx)

Thus we need to improve our miss rate by a factor of 3 to double the
performance.
