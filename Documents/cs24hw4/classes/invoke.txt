We have %r8 containing a properly initialized Shape subclass and we want
to invoke the virtual function of getVolume on it. Here is the assembly code
for this procedure:

        movq (%r8), %rdi    #moves object address to rdi
        
        movq (%rdi), %r9    # moves class address to r9

        movq (%r9), %r10    # moves function address to r10

        call *%r10          # call r10 on dereferenced object
