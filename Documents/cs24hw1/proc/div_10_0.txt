If the input is 10 divided by 0, the program will experience an infinite
loop. In this scenario, the statement which is (remainder = remainder - divisor)
will have no effect since the divisor is zero. Therefore, the remainder will
always be positive. Since the remainder will always be positive, the exit
conditions for the loop will never be met i.e. an inf loop. In our case,
the program will terminate after certain amount of time saying that the max
time was reached.
