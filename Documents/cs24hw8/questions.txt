Answers to HW8 Questions
========================

a)  How to detect when a page is accessed?

With mmap(), we can set the access permissions to PROT_NONE when adding the 
page to the virtual memory space or use mprotect() to set the access 
permissions to PROT_NONE. Thus, when we try to access this page for a read
or write, it will cause a segfault which we can process to know it was the
first time the page was accessed. Then, we set the accessed bit to 1.


b)  How to detect when a page becomes dirty?

We give the initial permissions to a page to be PROT_NONE when adding
the page to the virtual memory space. Then we a segfault happens
during asking for PROT_WRITE, we set the dirty bit to 1. Then we know
that a page with a dirty bit of 1 is dirty.


f)  Page-load rate of "test_matrix -m 1024 1000" using RANDOM policy:

There were 53637 total page loads when this command was run.

g)  Page Replacement Policy #1 (fill in the information below)

Name of policy you chose to implement:  CLOCK

Below, give the command-line for invoking the matrix-test program for a
1000x1000 matrix, with a maximum of 1024 resident pages.  (If multiple
steps are required, list them all here.)

  >>> test_matrix_clock -m 1024 1000

Give the resulting page-load rate of the above command:  7806

If you have any additional information to share about your policy, please
share it here.  Please keep your comments brief; you don't need to repeat
what the assignment says about the policy here.


h)  Page Replacement Policy #2 (if you implemented two policies)

Name of policy you chose to implement:  Aging

Below, give the command-line for invoking the matrix-test program for a
1000x1000 matrix, with a maximum of 1024 resident pages.  (If multiple
steps are required, list them all here.)

  >>>./test_matrix_aging -m 1024 1000

Give the resulting page-load rate of the above command:  32755

My code was taking a long time so it wasn't running for other values but the code
is set up such that you can do 8, 16, or 32.

If you have any additional information to share about your policy, please

what the assignment says about the policy here.
