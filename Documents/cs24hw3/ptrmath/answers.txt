Answers for the "Arrays, Pointer Arithmetic, and Structs" section of CS24 HW3:

Part 1)

The ending value of the bytes is:

0 0 0 EF BE AD DE 0 0 0 0 0 BE BA FE CA


Part 2)

The size of the id integer is 4 bytes. The offset is 0.
The size of the code is 5 bytes. The offset is 8 bytes.
The size of the next pointer is 8 bytes. The offset is 16 bytes.

The total size of the struct is 24 bytes with 7 bytes being "unused" as padding.



Part 3)

if 'offset' == 107, then the two lines of code will write to the same byte.
